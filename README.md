# Mocha Practice

Using what we learned about testing, i created the practice project in a way that it is reliable, maintainable, and expressive, by using comments i also specified what is happening where, this makes the code that much more presentable and easy to understand, this file contains a series of simple tests to get accusted to the assert library.
